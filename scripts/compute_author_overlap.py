"""
Compute author overlap between original and replication studies.

For each replication, checks whether any author family name from the
original study also appears in the replication's author list.
Family names are normalised (lowercase, diacritics stripped) before
comparison to reduce false negatives.  False positives remain possible
for common family names — this is noted in the dashboard.
